'''Question Amazon | OA 2019 | Minimum distance to remove obstacle
You are in charge of preparing a recently purchased lot for Amazonâ€™s building.
 The lot is covered with trenches and has a single obstacle that needs to be taken down
  before the foundation is prepared for the building. The demolition robot must remove
  the obstacle before the progress can be made on the building. Write an algorithm
  to determine the minimum distance required for the demolition robot to remove the obstacle
  1 is path and 9 is the obstacle set on its path.
  * I assume the path starts at lot[0][0]
