# e.g. 123
# 123
# 132  #reverse numbers after 1
# 213
# 231
# 312
# 321  <- all numbers are in decreasing order
# [algorithm]
1) find the first decreasing number when going backwards from the back. 1247651 <--4
2) swap with the number with the largest decrease. (or a number just larger than the number from step)
12476*5*1   <--5 in this case. swap with 4
1257641
3) reverse all numbers after 5
1251467
