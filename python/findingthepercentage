#hackerrank problem finding the percentage
# You have a record of N students. Each record contains the student's name, 
# and their percent marks in Maths, Physics and Chemistry. The marks can be floating values. 
# The user enters some integer  followed by the names and marks for students.
# You are required to save the record in a dictionary data type. 
# The user then enters a student's name. Output the average percentage marks obtained by that student, correct to two decimal places.
